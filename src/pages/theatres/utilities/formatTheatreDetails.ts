/**
 * Formats a {@link TheatreDetails} object into a concise and display-ready structure,
 * including readable address and summary details.
 *
 * This utility is commonly used by UI components such as
 * {@link TheatreQuickOverviewFetchCard} to render human-friendly
 * theatre summaries.
 *
 * It extracts key fields such as the number of screens, seats,
 * and upcoming showings, and joins the location parts into a single
 * address string.
 *
 * @param theatre - The full theatre data object to format.
 * @returns An object containing both raw and formatted fields:
 *
 * - `name`: The theatre name.
 * - `seatCapacity`: Maximum seat capacity (if available).
 * - `seatCount`: Total number of seats across all screens.
 * - `screenCount`: Number of screens in the theatre.
 * - `futureShowingCount`: Number of upcoming scheduled showings.
 * - `address`: Combined string of street, city, state, and country.
 * - `details`: A short textual summary such as `"8 screens, 1200 seats, 5 showings"`.
 * - `location`: The original location object from {@link TheatreDetails}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const formatted = formatTheatreDetails(theatre);
 * console.log(formatted.address);
 * // "123 Main St, Springfield, IL, United States"
 *
 * console.log(formatted.details);
 * // "8 screens, 1200 seats, 5 showings"
 * ```
